This is a car race project. It uses html/css/jquery.
In this project I have used various jquery techinques like animate etc.
Every time the we click on go the completetion time for both the cars is calculated and the race begins. The race is very random and and is very interesting.
The winner is the one who reaches the finish line first, and the time it takes for each one of the cars and place whether first or second is displayed on screen after race completetion.
